My name is Paulo and I'm currently an IT security analyst in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

I really like to code. Back to 1999, when I was in high school, a friend of mine gave me a tutorial of how to code in Pascal. I made some "writeln" and "readln" and I got thrilled with that. It was my first programming language. Since then, I have learned C++, PHP, and some others. I've been a software engineer, professionally, for 5 years. Then I started working with information security and, naturally, I brought coding along.

I have some hobbies: investing, chess, economics and running are some of them.

P.S.:
Life is ironic: I don't code anything in Pascal, my first programming language, the one that gave birth to all of this. :-)
